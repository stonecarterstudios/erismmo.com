      <description>Eris is a dark fantasy Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) with an emphasis on massive sieges. The game-play focuses on political alliances, feudal conquest and open world Player vs Player (PvP).
Wars are entirely player-driven, and notable player characters could find themselves with much fame and influence over the game. Players have the freedom to play as they like â€“ the leader of an independent merchant city state, a thief preying on the unaware, an assassin who kills for the thrill, a valiant knight who protects his homeland, a mercenary company captain who fights for money or a warlord set on world domination.</description>
